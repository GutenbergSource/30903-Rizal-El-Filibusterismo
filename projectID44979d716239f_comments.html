<p><i>El Filibusterismo</i>, (<i>the subversive</i>), is José Rizal's second novel. This is the original Spanish, from a facsimile of the very rare first printing, which was published in Gent (Belgium) in 1891. The English translation is already available on PG as <i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10676">The Reign of Greed</a></i> (Modern translations are still published in the Philippines, but use the orginal Spanish title). In this work, Rizal hardens his stance against the colonial rule of Spain in the Philippines. This work, printed on his own expense in Belgium, was actively suppressed in the author's homeland, and ultimately led to his execution in 1896.
